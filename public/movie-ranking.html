<h1>The Best Movies According to Zarifah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Brave</h3>
<p>With the Pixar touch, Brave grants its princess and her relationship with her family greater breathing room than those reliant on how she defies or falls into gender roles.</p>
<h3>The Princess Diaries</h3>
<p> The series revolves around Amelia 'Mia' Thermopolis, a teenager in New York who discovers that she is the princess of a small European principality called Genovia.</p>
<h3>Up</h3>
<p>Many a Pixar fan knows how much of a tearjerker famed film Up can be, particularly with its themes about life, grief, and never losing touch with your inner child.</p>
